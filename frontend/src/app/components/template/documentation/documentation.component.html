  <p><b> I – Creating a score for each country </b></p>
  <p>
    We based our score on the HDI – Human Development Index, which is composed by health (life expectancy), education
    and income. For the ScorVid, we have used only the variables of health and income, because these are the most
    correlated variables in our judgement. In addition, we have analyzed two more variables: management of the public
    sector according to the Corruption Perception Index and particular matter volume (pollution).
  </p>
  <p> <b> II – Calculating the variables </b> </p>
  <p>
    Health: we have calculated the variable “health” with the most recent data extracted from the report “Life
    expectance at birth” (2018) of the UNDP – United Nations Development Programme by using the formula:
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    <b>
      (X-MIN)/(MAX-MIN)
    </b>
  </p>
  Where X is the life expectancy for the analyzed country, MIN is the minimal life expectancy of the dataset, and MAX is
  the maximal life expectancy of the dataset.
  <p>
    Income: we have calculated the variable “income” with data extracted from the report “Gross domestic product per
    capita, current prices” (2019) projected for 2019 of the IMF – International Monetary Fund by using the formula:
  </p>
  <p class="text-center"><b>
      [log(X)-log(MIN)]/[log(MAX)-log(MIN)]
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Where X is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita for the analyzed country, MIN is the minimal value for GDP
    per capita of the dataset, and MAX is the maximal value for GDP per capita of the dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Management of the public sector: we have calculated the variable “document” with data extracted from “CPI –
    Corruption Perceptions Index” of the Transparency International, by using the formula:
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    <b>
      (X-MIN)/(MAX-MIN)
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Where X is the the CPI value for the analyzed country, MIN is the minimal value of the dataset, and MAX is the
    maximal value of the dataset.
